        "Purpose:\n",
        "The goal was to model and forecast AMD’s monthly closing stock prices using seasonal time series techniques. The analysis aimed to identify trends and patterns, compare models, and generate a 12-month forecast.\n",

        "This project provides context for AMD's recent stock performance. According to the story, AMD is under pressure from Nvidia's fierce competition in AI chips as well as sluggish sales of PCs and servers. Despite this, it continues to grow in certain markets and surpasses Intel in market share. These conflicting signals are reflected in our time series model. It displays AMD's stock's general increasing trajectory while also highlighting recent dips and volatility, such as the Q4 2024 fall linked to lower GPU sales. We capture the influence of significant events such as AMD's acquisitions, product releases, and industry shifts by modelling data from 2018 to early 2025. Although the forecast calls for consistent growth, it ignores rapidly shifting variables like market mood and new product cycles, which the essay demonstrates are obviously affecting AMD's present valuation."
